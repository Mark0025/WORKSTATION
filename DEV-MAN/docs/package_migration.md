# Package Migration Plan

## Current Setup
- Using multiple venvs (crewai-env2, api_test)
- UV for package management
- Working crew system
- Direct imports working

## Benefits of Migration
1. **Better Dependency Resolution**
   - Solves current conflicts
   - Modern packaging approach
   - Better version management

2. **Maintains Compatibility**
   - All current imports stay valid
   - No code changes needed
   - Existing venvs remain functional

3. **Improved Development**
   - Single source of truth
   - Better tool integration
   - Cleaner dependency management

## Risk Assessment
### Low Risk ✅
- Package structure stays same
- Import paths unchanged
- UV compatibility maintained
- Existing venvs untouched

### Medium Risk ⚠️
- Need to update documentation
- May need path adjustments
- Initial install process changes

### High Risk ❌
- None identified

## Migration Steps
1. **Backup Phase**
