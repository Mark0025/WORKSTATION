## Analysis
- I used placeholder keys (sk-1234, etc.) instead of the actual keys from the test report
- The first key still had the organization ID issue
- Need to get the actual working keys from the test report

## Next Steps
1. Extract actual working keys from test logs
2. Remove any organization ID references
3. Rerun tests with real keys
